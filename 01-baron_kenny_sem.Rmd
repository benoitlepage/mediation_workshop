# Baron and Kenny, structural equation models {#ChapBaronKennySem}

The Baron and Kenny approach can be applied if we make the assumption that no confounder of the $M \rightarrow Y$ relationship is affected by the exposure $A$. As a consequence we will use the `df1.csv` data set simulated from the Causal model 1 (Figure \@ref(fig:figDAGM1)). We will also assume that there is no $A \ast M$ interaction effect on the outcome $Y$ in the following examples. Such interaction effects can be dealt with using traditional regression models in very similar approaches described in chapter \@ref(ChapTradRegModels).

## Baron and Kenny approach

The Baron & Kenny approach relies on sequential and step-wise estimation of linear regression models:

  - A model for the total effect of the exposure $A$ on the outcome $Y$ (conditional on baseline confounders $L(0)$)
  
  \begin{equation*}
    \mathbb{E}(Y \mid A,L(0)) = \theta_0 + \theta_A A + \theta_{L(0)} L(0)
  \end{equation*}
  
  - A model to test if the exposure $A$ has an effect on the mediator $M$ (conditional on baseline confounders $L(0)$ of the $A-M$ relationship)
  
  \begin{equation*}
    \mathbb{E}(M \mid A,L(0)) = \beta_0 + \beta_A A + \beta_{L(0)} L(0)
  \end{equation*}
  
  - A model to estimate the direct effect of the exposure $A$ on the outcome $Y$ as well as the effect of the mediator $M$ on the outcome, adjusted for baseline confounders $L(0)$ and confounders of the $M-Y$ relationship $L(1)$
  
  \begin{equation*}
    \mathbb{E}(Y \mid A,M,L(1),L(0)) = \gamma_0 + \gamma_A A + \gamma_M M + \gamma_{L(0)} L(0) + \gamma_{L(1)} L(1)
  \end{equation*}

The total effect is given by the $\theta_A$ coefficient from the 1st model.

The direct effect is given by the $\gamma_A$ coefficient from the 3rd model.

The indirect effect can be calculated using: 

  - the "difference in coefficient" method based on the 1st and 3rd models: $\theta_A - \gamma_A$,
  - or the "product of coefficient" method based on the 2nd and 3rd models: $\beta_A \times \gamma_M$.

## Model 1 to estimate the total effect:
model.tot.A.QoL <- lm(Y_qol ~ A0_PM2.5 + L0_male + L0_soc_env,
                      data = df1)
summary(model.tot.A.QoL)
# Coefficients:
#               Estimate Std. Error t value Pr(>|t|)
#   (Intercept)  71.8820     0.2155 333.565  < 2e-16 ***
#   A0_PM2.5     -5.0961     0.3486 -14.617  < 2e-16 *** <- Total effect
#   L0_male      -1.1486     0.2194  -5.235 1.68e-07 ***
#   L0_soc_env   -3.4441     0.2295 -15.005  < 2e-16 ***

# The total effect of being exposed to high levels of PM_2.5 on Quality of life
# is approximately equal to an average decrease of -5.1 on the QoL scale,
# given by the A0_PM2.5 coefficient:
model.tot.A.QoL$coefficients["A0_PM2.5"]
# -5.096057

## Model 2 to estimate the effect of the exposure on the mediator
## because the mediator is binary, we might want to use a logistic or probit regression
## for example
logit.model.A.M <- glm(M_diabetes ~ A0_PM2.5 + L0_male + L0_soc_env,
                       data = df1, family = "binomial")
summary(logit.model.A.M)
# effects estimated on the logit scale:
# Coefficients:
#                          Estimate Std. Error z value Pr(>|z|)
#   (Intercept) -1.27152    0.04584 -27.736  < 2e-16 ***
#   A0_PM2.5     0.56168    0.06537   8.592  < 2e-16 *** <- effect of A on M

exp(coefficients(logit.model.A.M)["A0_PM2.5"])
# Odds ratio = 1.753609  for the effect of being exposed to high levels of PM_2.5
# on the mediator (probability of type 2 diabetes)

## Model 3 to estimate the direct effect of the exposure (conditional on the outcome) and
## the effect of M on Y, adjusted for confounders of the A-Y and M-Y relationships
model.A.M.QoL <- lm(Y_qol ~ A0_PM2.5 + M_diabetes + L1 + L0_male + L0_soc_env,
                    data = df1)
summary(model.A.M.QoL)
# Coefficients:
#               Estimate Std. Error t value Pr(>|t|)
#   (Intercept)  74.7858     0.2130 351.178  < 2e-16 ***
#   A0_PM2.5     -3.9650     0.3212 -12.345  < 2e-16 *** <- Direct effect
#   M_diabetes   -8.7138     0.2221 -39.237  < 2e-16 *** <- effect of M on Y
#   L1           -3.4252     0.2212 -15.483  < 2e-16 ***
#   L0_male      -0.7193     0.2017  -3.566 0.000364 ***
#   L0_soc_env   -2.8876     0.2112 -13.674  < 2e-16 ***

# The direct effect of PM_2.5 is approximately -4.0 given by the A0_PM2.5 coefficient
model.A.M.QoL$coefficients["A0_PM2.5"]
# -3.965038

## Following the Baron & Kenny Steps, we would conclude that :
# - There is a significant total effect of PM_2.5 on Quality of Life (Model 1)
# - There is a significant effect of PM_2.5 on the mediator (diabetes) (Model 2)
# - There is a significant effect of the mediator (diabetes) on Qol (model 3)
# - The direct effect is significantly non-null
# => Conclusion: Diabetes partially mediates the relationship between PM_2.5 and QoL

### Estimation of the indirect effect:
### We can apply the difference in coefficient method to estimate the indirect effect:
### substract the direct effect from the Total effect:
ind.effect.dif.meth <- (model.tot.A.QoL$coefficients["A0_PM2.5"] -
                          model.A.M.QoL$coefficients["A0_PM2.5"])
# -1.131019
# the indirect effect is approximately -1.1
# The confidence interval of the indirect effect can be computed by bootstrap.

# Because the mediator is binary and we applied a logistic regression for Model 2,
# we cannot apply the product of coefficients combining a coefficient from
# Model 2 (logit scale) and from Model 3 (difference scale)

### Model 2bis
# Surprisingly, another possibility is to run a linear model of the binary mediator
# instead of the logistic regression to apply the "product of coefficient method"
# in order to estimate the indirect effect:
linear.model.A.M <- lm(M_diabetes ~ A0_PM2.5 + L0_male + L0_soc_env,
                       data = df1)
summary(linear.model.A.M)
# Coefficients:
#             Estimate Std. Error t value Pr(>|t|)
# (Intercept) 0.215398   0.008929  24.123  < 2e-16 ***
# A0_PM2.5    0.127180   0.014446   8.804  < 2e-16 *** <- effect of A on M
# L0_male     0.052363   0.009091   5.760 8.67e-09 ***
# L0_soc_env  0.065806   0.009511   6.919 4.83e-12 ***

## product of coefficient method:
ind.effect.prod.meth <- (linear.model.A.M$coefficients["A0_PM2.5"] *
                           model.A.M.QoL$coefficients["M_diabetes"])
# -1.108213
# which also gives an indirect effect of approximately -1.1
```

The Baron & Kenny approach is usually applied for continuous outcomes, using linear regressions. It is less adapted for binary outcomes.

However, as for the binary mediator, some authors suggested that using linear regressions of the mediator and the outcome could still give some results.

## Path analysis and Structural Equation Modeling
Path analyses can be considered as a "generalization" of the product of coefficients method. They combine graphical representation of causal structures, a set of linear equations and assumptions concerning the covariance structure of residuals.

When the causal model includes latent variables (represented by a measurement model), we refer to the analysis as structural equation modeling.

Variables which does not receive causal inputs from any other variable in the diagram are called exogenous variables. Unless the assumption is explicitly made that two exogenous variables are uncorrelated (because they do not have any common causal factor), it is preferable to consider them as not independent (connecting them by double arrows).

In the `df1.csv` data set, there are 3 exogenous variables: `L0_male`, `L0_soc_env` and `L1`.

We will use the [`lavaan`](https://lavaan.ugent.be/) R package to run path analyses.

  - The first step is to write the model syntax
  - The second step is to analyze the model with the dataset
  
**First step**. Let us write the model syntax to analyze the effect of being exposed to high levels of $\text{PM}_{2.5}$ on quality of life, mediated by type-2 diabetes.

We have to define:

  - regression models for the endogenous variables: exposure to $\text{PM}_{2.5}$ (`A0_PM2.5`), type-2 diabetes (`M_diabetes`) and quality of life (`Y_qol`)
  - covariance assumptions for the exogenous variables
  - we can also define additional parameters of interest (in our case, direct, indirect and total effects)
```{r sem_model_qol, echo=TRUE, eval = FALSE}
sem.QoL <- "                                 # models are written between quotes
## Regression models
## we can also add the names of some path coefficients 
  A0_PM2.5 ~ L0_male + L0_soc_env
  M_diabetes ~ L0_male + L0_soc_env + b.A * A0_PM2.5 + L1   # label b.A path coef
  Y_qol ~ L0_male + L0_soc_env + c.A*A0_PM2.5 + L1 + c.M*M_diabetes # label c.A and c.M

## Covariances
# Assuming a non-null covariance between confounders 
# covariances are represented with a double tilde ~~ (double arrow)
# (note: in the data-generating system, the null assumptions were true)
  L0_male ~~ L0_soc_env
  L0_male ~~ L1
  L0_soc_env ~~ L1

## We can define other parameters to estimate, using the := syntax
## we want the direct, indirect and total effects:
  direct := c.A
  indirect := b.A * c.M
  total := (b.A * c.M) + c.A
"
```

**Second step**. Let us analyze the model with the `df1.csv` dataset using the `sem` function from the `lavaan` package.

Binary exogenous variables (`L0_male`,`L0_soc_env` and `L1`) can be coded as simple dummy (0/1) variables, there is no need to declare them as `factors`. 

Note that in the following example, we will not declare the other binary variables (`A0_PM2.5`,`M_diabetes`) as factors and let them as simple dummy variables.

Running the `sem` function with the `df1.csv` dataset, we obtain: 

  - information about the estimator
  - estimates of the regression models
  - estimates of the covariance between exogenous variables
  - estimates of the residual variances
  - estimates of the additional parameters (direct, indirect and total effects)

The Baron & Kenny approach gave us the following results:

  - direct effect = -3.965
  - indirect effect = -1.131 (using the "difference in coefficients" method) or -1.108213 (using the "product of coefficients" method)
  - total effect = -5.096
  
The path analysis results from `lavaan` are very close the the Baron & Kenny results.

We can plot the estimated model using the `semPlot` package (Figure \@ref(fig:FigSemPlotQol1)):
